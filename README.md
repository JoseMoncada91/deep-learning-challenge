AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization - Deep Learning Challenge

Jose Moncada - Module #21

Project Overview

This project is part of Module 21 - Deep Learning Challenge. The goal is to build, train, and optimize a deep learning model to predict the success of charitable donations using a dataset from AlphabetSoup.

Files in This Repository

Steps Completed

Data Preprocessing:

Loaded and cleaned the dataset.

Encoded categorical variables.

Scaled the numerical features.

Model Creation:

Built a sequential deep learning model using TensorFlow/Keras.

Used appropriate activation functions and loss metrics.

Training & Evaluation:

Trained the model with multiple epochs and batch sizes.

Evaluated model performance using accuracy and loss.

Optimization:

Adjusted hyperparameters (number of layers, neurons, activation functions).

Improved the model performance from the baseline.

Model Export:

Saved the trained model to an HDF5 file (AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization.h5).

Instructions for Running the Model

Ensure Python is installed along with TensorFlow, Pandas, and Scikit-learn.

Run the Jupyter Notebook (alphabet_soup_nn.ipynb) to train and evaluate the model.

The final trained model is saved as AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization.h5 and can be loaded for future predictions.

Notes

The saved model file is located in the same directory as the project files.

The model was optimized for improved accuracy compared to the initial baseline model.
